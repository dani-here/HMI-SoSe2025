##  Overview

A research study developed during the Summer Semester 2025 by students at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences for the course of Human Machine Interaction under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Valentin Schwind.

## Purpose

This research investigates how users perceive and evaluate the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) across different types of tasks. The goal is to better understand in which contexts LLMs perform well or poorly, and how users recognize potential quality issues in their outputs.

##  Features

- **Front-end**: Dynamic UI components developed in NextJS.
- **Back-end**: Business logic and API services written in C# (.NET 9.0).
