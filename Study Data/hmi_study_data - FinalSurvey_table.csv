It could switch tones easily (casual, promotional, analytical, creative), which helped me see how the same content can be framed differently.

Less helpful:  In creative writing prompts, sometimes the first drafts felt too safe or generic.

Partially unexpected: Sometimes the responses leaned a bit too “polished” or generic, especially in creative writing, where I expected more unpredictability or originality.

Tone flexibility: Sometimes the style felt too polished; adding a “casual/raw/human” toggle would make outputs feel more natural when needed.  Clarification prompts: When a task is ambiguous (e.g., reviewing a suitcase scale), the LLM could briefly ask for clarification instead of assuming the format.
