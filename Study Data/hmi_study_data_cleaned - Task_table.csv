It reminds me of the way tech companies are always trying to one-up each other or stealing each other's ideas and people when they can't. And you and me? Well, we're sitting on the sidelines cheering on the next big thing.",Summarize the article in exactly 3 sentences.

Sample 3:   Hello from France,  This could be a historic moment—or it could all yet fall apart. The presidents of America and Russia are to meet in Alaska on August 15th. Details could easily change before Friday, but the current plan is to exclude Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his European backers from the summit. Already Mr Trump—a poor negotiator—has suggested some territory could be swapped. That sounds like a concession even before talks begin.
